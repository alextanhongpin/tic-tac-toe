# Tic-Tac-Toe
A naive minmax algorithm implementation for tic-tac-toe in javascript.

There are several ways of solving tic-tac-toe:

1. Minimax Algorithm
2. Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning (a more efficient way of solving Tic-Tac-Toe with less search space)
3. Q-learning (Reinforcement learning)

This repo will contain tutorials on how to solve all three of them.
